## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about how to adjust the text decoration in lists. This was my first time editing them to this degree and I like the ability to design to this level.

### Continued development

I want more practice working with tables, I haven't gotten to create them much but they are useful and practice makes better!

### Useful resources

- [MDN Tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) - This has all of the fundamental information on tables.
